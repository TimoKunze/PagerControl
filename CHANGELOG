- Project published on GitHub.



Version 1.2.2 - 29/07/2016

- Fixed some memory leaks that occurred when firing certain events.



Version 1.2.1 - 30/01/2016

- FIX: The control could crash during OLE drag'n'drop.
- FIX: The control could crash the other process during OLE drag'n'drop, especially when IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() had been called.



Version 1.2.0 - 19/01/2016

- Added the IPager::FinishOLEDragDrop method. It should not be used if not really needed. It can be used to hide the drag image if execution of the OLEDragDrop event takes a long time or if a message is displayed from within this event.
- Initial support for Windows 10.



Version 1.1.0 - 01/08/2014

- Added the XClick, and XDblClick events for support of the extended mouse buttons.
- Extended the Mouse* events to support the extended mouse buttons.
- FIX: The MouseIcon property could leak GDI resources.
- Reactivated data-binding capabilities. When the library is registered, it will call regtlib.exe msdatsrc.tlb before registering itself. This seems to fix the mess caused by the broken Windows Update from the beginning of 2013.
- Initial support for Windows 8.1.



Version 1.0.0 - 09/05/2013

- First public release.
